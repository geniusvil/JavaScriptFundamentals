        Problem 4 – Dancing Bits
Gergana loves dancing and she also likes bits (she doesn't know what bits really are, but she knows that she likes them). Few days ago she accidently invented a new term - “dancing bits”.
If you ask her what “dancing bits” mean she will tell you that it’s a sequence of identical bits (so the bits can dance together – zeros can only dance with other zeros, the same applies for ones).
You are given N positive integer numbers that are converted to binary numeral system and are concatenated together in one big sequence of bits. 
For example: if we have 4 numbers: 5 (101 in binary numeral system), 6 (110 in binary numeral system), 14 (1110 in binary numeral system) and 143 (1000111 in binary numeral system) their concatenation will be 101110111010001111.
You are also given a positive integer K - the number of identical bits (zeroes or ones that can dance together).
Write a program that finds the number of all “dancing bits” (the sequences of equal bits) with a length of exactly K bits. Your program should search in the concatenation of the given N numbers.
For example, if we have 4 numbers (5, 6, 14 and 143, the concatenation of their binary representation is 101110111010001111) and we are searching for the total number of all sequences of equal bits with an exact length of 3 bits, the answer will be 3 (the sequences are bolded in the concatenation above).
In this example we have two sequences of “dancing bits” - "111" consisting of only ones and one sequence of “dancing bits” - "000" consisting of only zeros. Note that the sequence "1111" is not a sequence of exact 3 identical bits.
Input
The input data should be read from the console.
At the first input line there will be one positive integer – the number K.
At the second input line there will be another positive integer – the number N.
At each of the next N lines there will be one positive integer – the N numbers that represent the input sequence of bits.
The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
Output
The output data should be printed on the console.
The only output line must contain the answer – the number of “dancing bits” sequences found. 
Constraints
The number K will be positive integer number between 1 and 25 600, inclusive.
The number N will be positive integer number between 1 and 800, inclusive.
Each of the N numbers will be positive integer numbers between 1 and 2 147 483 647, inclusive.
Allowed working time for your program: 0.20 seconds.
Allowed memory: 16 MB.
