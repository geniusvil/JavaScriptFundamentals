        Problem 3 – Excel Columns
Columns are a fundamental part of any spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel. Columns run vertically in a worksheet. Each column is identified by a capital Latin letters in the column header starting with column with identifier A and running through to column with identifier Z. After Z you get AA, AB, AC etc. until you get to AZ. Then it is BA, BB, BC, …, ZY, ZZ, AAA, AAB, …, AAZ, ABA, …, ZZY, ZZZ, AAAA, AAAB and so on… The last column is ZZZZZZZZZZ.
Recently Todor has learned how to work with Excel. Since then all that he do is giving integer indices to every possible column. Starting from the first column A (with index 1), through Z (with index 26), AA (with index 27), and so on. Of course this is a very, very hard and time-wasting job. You, as programmer, know that this can be solved easily with a computer program.
Help Todor by writing a program that converts excel column identifier to a column index.
Input
The input data should be read from the console.
On the first line of the input there will be an integer N – column identifier length.
On each of the next N lines there will be a single character. All characters together construct a column identifier.
The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
Output
The output data should be printed on the console.
On the only output line print the column index.
Constraints
N will be between 1 and 10, inclusive.
Each column character in the input will be capital Latin letter (‘A’ – ‘Z’)
Allowed work time for your program: 0.1 seconds. Allowed memory: 16 MB.
