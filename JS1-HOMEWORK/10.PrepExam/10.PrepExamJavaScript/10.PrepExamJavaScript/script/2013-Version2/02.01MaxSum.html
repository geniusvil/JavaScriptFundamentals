        Problem 1 – Max Sum
You are given an integer array arr, consisting of N integers. Find the maximum possible sum of consecutive numbers in arr. For example: if the array arr consists of the numbers 1, 6, -9, 4, 4, -2, 10, -1, the maximum possible sum of consecutive numbers is 16 (the consecutive numbers are 4, 4, -2 and 10) 
Your task is to write a JavaScript method named “Solve” that solves the problem.
Input
The method Solve accepts a zero-based array of strings. Each of the string represents an integer. Element 0 of the array is the number N. Next N elements (from 1 to N) construct the array arr.
Output
Your method should return a single number - the maximum possible sum of consecutive numbers.
Example code
function Solve(args) {
	var N = parseInt(args[0]);
	var answer = 0;
	// Your code here...
	return answer;
}
Constraints
N will be between 1 and 500.
Each element of arr will be between -2 000 000 and +2 000 000.
Allowed working time for your program: 0.2 seconds. Allowed memory: 16 MB.
