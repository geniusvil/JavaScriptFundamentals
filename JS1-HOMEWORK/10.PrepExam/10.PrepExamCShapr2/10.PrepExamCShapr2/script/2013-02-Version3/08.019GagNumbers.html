        Problem 1 – 9Gag Numbers
In 9Gag we like fun. We have a lot of time and we play with fun pictures and fun stories. Recently we invented a funny way to express numbers. We use the following 9 digits:
0
-!
1
**
2
!!!
3
&&
4
&-
5
!-
6
*!!!
7
&*!
8
!!**!-
We write the numbers as sequences digits from our 9 available digits given above. The last digit of the number (the most right one) has a value as shown in the above table. The next digit on the left has a value 9 times bigger than the shown in the above table, the next digit on the left has 9*9 times bigger value than the shown in the table and so on. Your task is to write a program to convert a 9Gag-style number into its corresponding decimal representation.
Input
The input data consists of a single string – a 9Gag-style number.
The input data will always be valid and in the described format. There is no need to check it explicitly.
Output
The output data consists of a single line holding the calculated decimal representation of the given 9Gag-style number and should be printed at the console.
Constraints
The input number will have between 1 and 20 digits.
Allowed working time for your program: 0.1 seconds.
Allowed memory: 16 MB.
