        Problem 1 – Zerg!!!
The Prelate Zeratul and the High Templar Tassadar, highly psionic alien life forms from the Protoss race, got together to understand the low-level basic xenomorphic Zerg (in Bulgarian “дзверг“) communication. After years of energy transformation, deep meditation and thousands of Hydralisks cut into pieces, they finally found the answer – the awful creatures send each other encrypted numeric messages (like SMS but without mobile phones).
The messages are made of the following digits: 
0
Rawr
1
Rrrr
2
Hsst
3
Ssst
4
Grrr
5
Rarr
6
Mrrr
7
Psst
8
Uaah
9
Uaha
10
Zzzz
11
Bauu
12
Djav
13
Myau
14
Gruh
Messages are written as a sequence of digits. The last digit of the number (the most right one) has a value as shown in the above table. The next digit on the left has a value 15 times bigger than the shown in the above table, the next digit on the left has 15*15 times bigger value than the shown in the table and so on. Since our Protoss warriors are too advanced to calculate such easy expressions (and on Aiur they do not use C# too), you task is to translate the message into its decimal representation. With your help, our heroes can finally understand the Zerg logic and bring peace to the entire Koprulu sector.
Input
The input data consists of a single line – the Zerg message.
The input data will always be valid and in the described format. There is no need to check it explicitly.
Output
The output data consists of a single line holding the calculated decimal representation of the given message number and should be printed at the console.
Constraints
The input number will have between 1 and 9 digits.
Allowed working time for your program: 0.1 seconds.
Allowed memory: 16 MB.
