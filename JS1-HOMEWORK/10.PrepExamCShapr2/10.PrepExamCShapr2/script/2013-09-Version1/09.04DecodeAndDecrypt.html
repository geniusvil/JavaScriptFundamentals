        Decode and Decrypt
So, being a KO-NE (Key Observation – Notification Expert), you really don't like the idea, that half the company you work for has started using a new method of messaging. This new method encrypts and encodes (compresses) the messages. Encoding is all well and good – company's saving on Broadband and all that jazz – but it's the encryption part you really have a problem with. After all, your job is "observation" and you really can't be effective at that when you can't even read the damn thing.
Good thing is, being as good as you are, you found the source of the idea for the messaging system – some old article, describing a primitive but effective encoding and encryption algorithm. So much for security by obscurity. Here's the encryption and encoding algorithm description from the article:
We are given a message and a cypher
The message is the text the user wants to transmit
The cypher is a string which is used to encrypt and decrypt the message
The encrypted message is called cypherText
We define a function Encrypt, which takes a message and a cypher:
It iterates over the symbols in the message and the cypher 
For each pair of symbols, it takes their codes (in the table below) and computes the bitwise XOR of the symbol in the message with the symbol in the cypher. 
The resulting code is summed with the ASCII code of the character 'A' (65), giving a new ASCII code
The character corresponding to this new ASCII code is the encrypted representation of the respective character in the message
If the cypher string is shorter than the message, using it symbols loops to the beginning of the cypher.  E.g. for a message "ABCDE" and a cypher "PQR" we will have:
'A' encrypted with 'P' = 'P', 'B' encrypted with 'Q' = 'R', 'C' encrypted with 'R' = 'T', 'D' encrypted with 'P' = 'M', 'E' encrypted with 'Q' = 'U'
If the message string is shorter than the cypher, some of its symbols will be encoded several times, until all of the cypher symbols are used.
E.g. for a message "ABC" and a cypher "PQRST", we will have:
'A' encrypted with 'P' and the result ('P') encrypted with 'S' = '^' (ASCII 94), 
'B' encrypted with 'Q' and the result ('R') encrypted with 'T' = 'C',
'C' encrypted only with 'R' =  'T'
We define a function Encode, which takes a string of text to compress:
It looks for sequences of symbols which are the same(e.g. 'aaaaa')
For each sequence of same symbols, the function replaces the sequence with a number representing the count of repeated symbols, followed immediately by the symbol which is repeated. This is called run-length encoding. E.g. for the text "aaaabbbccccaa" we will have "4a3b4caa".
The function replaces symbols in the aforementioned way ONLY if the run-length encoding of the same-symbol sequence is shorter than the sequence itself
That's why in the example above the last two a's remain the same – '2a' has the same length as 'aa'
Given the two functions, and given a message and a cypher, the encrypted message should be:
Encode(Encrypt(message, cypher) + cypher) + lengthOfCypher
'+' denotes concatenation, the two functions return strings and 'lengthOfCypher' is a number, which is equal to the number of symbols in the cypher
i.e. the message is encrypted with the cypher, then the cipher is added for decrypting purposes, then the result is compressed and a number denoting the length of the cypher before compression is added to the compressed string
Now, since you are very good, you know that the described Encrypt function actually works both ways – i.e. if something was encrypted with the function and a cypher, calling Encrypt again with the same cypher, but with the encrypted text, you will receive the original text.
For example, Encrypt("ABCDE", "PQR") = "PRTMU" and Encrypt("PRTMU", "PQR") = "ABCDE"
Where the fist parameter of Encrypt is the message and the second is the cypher
The Encode function is also relatively easy to reverse – just take the numbers and print the symbol after each number the corresponding … number … of times.
Now all you have to do is put the pieces together and you can once again spy on the messaging in the company.
Write a program, which by given an encrypted (with the above described method) message, recovers the original message
