Problem 4 – Fake Text Markup Language
Joro's trying to top the leaderboard on "weirdest things by the lectors" (yep, couldn't think of a better translation). Last time he used Paint for a color picker on a CSS lecture, now he's inventing a whole new markup language – the Fake Text Markup Language. It looks a bit like HTML – it has opening and closing tags, and those tags define the formatting of text… on the console! So, if we receive an FTML formatted text, we need to print the text content according to the following rules:
Tags can be opening and closing, e.g.: <upper> and </upper>
Tags can be nested, e.g.: <upper> this is a <lower> nested tag</lower>  in another tag </upper>
Nesting is measured in "depth", in this case <lower> is deeper than <upper>
Tags cannot "intersect", e.g.: <upper> this is <lower> very </upper> wrong </lower> is not valid
Tags don't appear in the resulting text, but they affect it
When tags are nested, the effect of the "deepest" is considered first, then the effect of the less deeper and so on
e.g.: <upper>Before nested <lower>Inside nested</lower> After nested</upper> 
will apply the effects of <lower> and then of <upper>
The end result will be: BEFORE NESTED INSIDE NESTED AFTER NESTED
The <upper> tag converts text to its uppercase variant
e.g.: <upper>tExT</upper> results in: TEXT
The <lower> tag converts text to its lowercase variant
e.g.: <lower>tExt</lower> results in: text
The <toggle> tag:
if a character is uppercase, it converts it to lowercase
if a character is lowercase, it converts it to uppercase
e.g. <toggle>tExT<toggle> results in: TeXt
<upper>, <lower> and <toggle> tags don't affect punctuation or whitespaces
The <del> tag deletes all text in it
e.g.: this is <del> this is deleted </del> some text results in: this is some text
The <rev> tag reverses all text in it
e.g.: 123 reversed is <rev>123</rev> results in: 123 reversed is 321
The FTML keeps all whitespaces and new lines (it doesn't remove them like HTML)
the only exception is, obviously, the <del> tag
Write a program, which formats code, according to the rules described.
Input
On the first line of the input, there will be the number N – the number of lines in the FTML text.
On each of the next lines there will be a line of the FTML text, consisting of English letters, punctuation and whitespaces (and of course FTML tags)
Output
On the console, you should print the lines of the formatted text. 
Constraints
0 < N < 500
The text input will NOT contain any '<' or '>', other than the ones for the tags
Allowed working time for your program: 0.1 seconds. Allowed memory: 16 MB.
