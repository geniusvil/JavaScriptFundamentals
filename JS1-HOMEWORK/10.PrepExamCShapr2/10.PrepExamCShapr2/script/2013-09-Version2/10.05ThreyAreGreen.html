        Problem 5 – They are Green
Mani and Kerankata ate shkembe chorba while suddenly Ivo from Undercover showed on the ultrasound. He had three eyes and could eat without a spoon. He predicted the coming of the Zelenite (a pure green race, who loved to land on NASA headquarters). Mankata was there and gave the green guys a bottle of Brendy, a fine little fermented sault and bread whiskey. Kerancho popped some popcorn with his mind waves but suddenly a Turkish series aired on another TV channel. The boy was a walking dead guy with Bulgarian “zabradka”, kidnapped cutely because of his explosives. Now he is a prisoner without any hope, without any exit, with his body parts attached to strange segments. The background music was Koli Venova, Draifa and Grivna and he was not sure how much he could handle, because of it his legs started itching from the inside of his bones. His kidnappers were Moisei and his semi-brother Devil. The second looked like a bag of fertilizer on a Z-Factor show. Mani got brain implants making him dumb and shy. He even started liking “Where is Shaggy?”. Suddenly his tummy became free zone because the alien ship does not have central heating system, all of his fingers transformed into a middle one. If someone received the message, please send an intergalactic backup!
So… You are given N letters. Write a program that finds the count of all words with no two consecutive equal characters that can be generated by reordering the given letters. The generated words should contain all given letters. If the given word meets the requirements it should also be considered in the count.
Input
The input data should be read from the console.
On the first input line there will be the number N – the count of the letters you should use.
On each of the next N lines, there will be a single character.
The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
Output
The output data should be printed on the console.
On the only output line write the count of the words found.
Constraints
N will be between 1 and 10, inclusive. All given letters will be small Latin letters (‘a’ – ‘z’)
Allowed working time for your program: 0.35 seconds. Allowed memory: 32 MB.
