        Problem 1 – Durankulak Numbers
In Durankulak we have a special way to write numbers. We use the following 168 digits:
A
B
C
…
Z
0
1
2
…
25
…
аA
аB
аC
…
аZ
26
27
28
…
51
…
bA
bB
bC
…
bZ
52
53
54
…
77
…
fA
…
fJ
fK
fL
156
…
165
166
167
We write the numbers as sequences of digits. The last digit of the number (the most right one) has a value as shown in the above table. The next digit on the left has a value 168 times bigger than the shown in the above table, the next digit on the left has 168*168 times bigger value than the shown in the table and so on. Your task is to write a program to convert a Durankulak-style number into its corresponding decimal representation.
Input
The input data consists of a single string – a Durankulak-style number.
The input data will always be valid and in the described format. There is no need to check it explicitly.
Output
The output data consists of a single line holding the calculated decimal representation of the given Durankulak-style number and should be printed at the console.
Constraints
The input string will have between 1 and 16 characters.
Allowed working time for your program: 0.1 seconds. Allowed memory: 16 MB.
