        Problem X – Patterns
You are given a matrix of numbers. By given the pattern below, find the pattern with maximal sum:
The pattern consists of neighbor cells in the matrix. The numbers in the cells must be consecutive, i.e. the following rules must be always valid:
A = B -1, B = C – 1, C = D – 1, D = F – 1, F = E – 1, E = G - 1
The size of the pattern is constant and always has the given form.
Example:
The patterns here are marks with green, blue and yellow colors:
The green pattern has a sum of its numbers 35
The blue pattern has a sum of its numbers 56
The yellow pattern has a sum of its numbers -14
The winning pattern is the blue with maximal sum of 56
Input
On the first line of the console you will find the number N – the number of rows and columns of the matrix
On the next N lines you will find exactly N numbers, separated by a space. This are the numbers of the matrix.
The input data will always be valid and in the described format. There is no need to check it explicitly.
Output
The output data consists of a single line. It should start with either “YES” or “NO”:
If at least one pattern is found in the matrix – print “YES {sum}”, where sum is the sum of the numbers in the maximal pattern
If no patterns are to be found in the matrix – print “NO {sum}”, where sum is the sum of the numbers, that are on the main diagonal of the matrix
Constraints
N will always be greater or equal to 5 and less or equal to 1000
The numbers in the matrix will always be between -2147483648 and 2147483647
Allowed working time for your program: 0.1 seconds.
Allowed memory: 16 MB.
