        Problem 1 – Sevenland Numbers
In Sevenland we use a numeral system of base 7. It consists of seven digits (instead of the traditional 10) and these 7 digits are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers in the system of base 7 are just like the decimal numbers, but after 6 the next number is 10. More general, the numbers in the 7-base numeral system are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, …, 16, 20, 21, …, 26, 30, …, 65, 66, 100, 101, …, 106, 110, …, 166, 200, …, 666, 1000.
Write a program that takes as input a 7-based integer number K and calculates and prints the next number following it (K+1).
Input
The input data should be read from the console and consists of a single line holding a 7-based integer K.
The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
Output
The output data should be printed on the console.
The output should consist of a single line holding the number K+1 (in 7-based numeral system).
Constraints
The number K is in the range [0…666] inclusive.
Allowed work time for your program: 0.1 seconds.
Allowed memory: 16 MB.
