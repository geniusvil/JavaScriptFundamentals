        Problem 4 – We All Love Bits!
One of the things the programmers love the most is bitwise operations. The "bitwise guy" is a synonym for a programmer that loves bits more than everything else in programming. Mitko is a "bitwise guy". He invented a new bitwise algorithm. The algorithm takes one positive integer number P, makes magic with it and returns a new positive integer number. He also defined a new number P̃ which represents the number P in binary numeral system with inverted bits. All zeros in P are ones in P̃ and all ones in P are zeros in P̃. For example if we have P = 9 (which is 1001 in binary numeral system) its inverted number P̃ will be equal to 6 (which is 110 in binary numeral system). But that’s not all! He invented another number P̈, which represents reversed number P in binary numeral system. For example if we have P = 11 (which is 1011 in binary numeral system) its reversed number P̈ is equal to 13 (which is 1101 in binary numeral system). The Mitko's magical algorithm takes a number P and transforms it to a new number Pnew using the following bitwise transformation: Pnew = (P ^ P̃) & P̈.
Your task is to write a program that transforms a sequence of N positive integer numbers using Mitko's algorithm.
Input
The input data should be read from the console.
At the first input line there will be one positive integer – the number N.
At each of the next N lines there will be one positive integer – the consequent number that must be converted using Mitko's algorithm.
The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
Output
The output data should be printed on the console.
The output must consist of N lines, containing the transformed numbers for each number from the input.
Constraints
The number N will be positive integer number between 1 and 20 000, inclusive.
Each of the N numbers will be positive integer numbers between 1 and 2 147 483 647, inclusive.
Allowed working time for your program: 0.20 seconds.
Allowed memory: 16 MB.
