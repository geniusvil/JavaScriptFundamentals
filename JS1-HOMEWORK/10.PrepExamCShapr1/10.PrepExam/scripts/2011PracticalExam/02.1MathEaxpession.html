Problem 1 – Math Expression
You are given the following mathematical expression:
The sin(x) is a trigonometric function that returns the sine from the angle x (measured in radians).
The mod operator finds the remainder of division of one number by another.
Here are some examples for how the mod operator should work:
5 mod 2 = 1
5.99 mod 3 = 2
6 mod 3 = 0
Your task is to write a computer program that calculates the result from the shown mathematical expression, depending on the values of the variables N, M and P.
Input
The input data is being read from the console.
The input consists of exactly 3 lines. In each line you consequently enter the variables N, M and P.
The separator between the integer and the fractional part of the number is “.” (dot).
The number of digits that follow the decimal point will not be more than 6.
The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
Output
The output data must be printed on the console.
There must be only one line, showing the result from the mathematical expression.
The result must show exactly 6 digits after the “.” (decimal point).
Constraints
The numbers N, M and P are fractional numbers.
N, M and P will be between -10 000 000 and 10 000 000, inclusive.
The numbers M and P will always have values other than 0
It is guaranteed that none of the combinations of the numbers N, M and P will lead to dividing by zero.
Allowed working time for your program: 0.10 seconds.
Allowed memory: 16 MB.
