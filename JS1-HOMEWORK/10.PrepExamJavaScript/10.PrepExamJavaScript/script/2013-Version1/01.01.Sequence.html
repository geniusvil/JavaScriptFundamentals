        Problem 1 – Sequences
You are given an integer array arr, consisting of N integers. Find the number of non-decreasing consecutive subsequences in arr. Every sequence starts after the previous one. For example: if the array arr consists of the numbers 1, 2, -3, 4, 4, 0, 1, the number of non-decreasing consecutive subsequences is 3 (the first is 1, 2, the second is -3, 4, 4 and the third is 0, 1) 
Your task is to write a JavaScript method named “Solve” that solves the problem.
Input
The method Solve accepts a zero-based array of strings. Each of the strings represents an integer. Element 0 of the array is the number N. Next N elements (from 1 to N) construct the array arr.
Output
Your method should return a single number - the number of non-decreasing consecutive subsequences.
Example code
function Solve(params) {
	var N = parseInt(params[0]);
	var answer = 0;
	// Your code here...
	return answer;
}
Constraints
N will be between 1 and 10 000.
Each element of arr will be between -2 000 000 000 and +2 000 000 000.
Allowed working time for your program: 0.1 seconds. Allowed memory: 16 MB.
