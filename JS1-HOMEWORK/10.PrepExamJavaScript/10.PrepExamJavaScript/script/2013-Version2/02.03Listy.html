        Problem 3 – Listy
Bai Ivan also known as @bivan27 is a famous blogger and developer. Because he is Bulgarian, he is not a big fan of buying software, so he doesn’t have a legal version of Microsoft Office. Also because of his neighbour who doesn’t like him and sends him bad boys from GDBOP(ГДБОП) every week to check his PC for illegal software, @bivan27 can’t use Excel.
One day @bivan27 decided to make his own programming language called Listy which will do Excel’s calculations with a list of numbers. His conception for now is very simple. He can assign lists to a variables, get the min or max value from a list, get average or sum the elements of the list. Each of the functions gets as a parameter array of numbers or variables in square brackets.”def” is a keyword used to define a variable. Here are some syntax examples.
Everything looks great? Right? But @bivan27 has some problem with his dog “Sharo” and he doesn’t have the time to make an interpreter for Listy. Help him by writing Listy interpreter in JavaScript, because tomorrow morning he has a meeting with new investors who want to use his project for calculation in Boza production.
 NOTE: There could be more than one or no whitespace between the characters. For example
 def     varName   sum   [    2,3,12 ,            4,   1         )  //Also has to return 22
Also you can use old functions in the definitions of the new one. The interpreter should run code in this format:
NOTE: There will be only a sequence of numbers and variables in the definition of a new variable. 
NOTE: There will be no nested commands in the given command
Example: Command can be “def var sum[1,2,3]” but it won’t be “def var sum[1,2,3, min[var0, 3,-5,2]]”
You are given an array of strings (commands). Execute all the commands and print the result only from the last line! 
If you meet a variable in a command it’ll be always defined in some of the lines before!
“- 5” is not valid number but “-5” is.
Variable’s names are case sensitive.
Variables cannot be overwritten.
Each string will be a valid Listy command.
Variable can contains definition of a number or list of numbers
If there is no operation on the last line, command will looks like “[var1]”. Otherwise if there is a final command it’ll be in format: “sum[var1,var2]” (or other operation)
Write method Solve that accepts the commands as array and prints the result of the last command.
Input
The method Solve accepts an array of strings. (Example: arr=[“command1”,”command2”,”command3”])
Output
Your method should return a single line - the result of the last command
Constraints
Array size will be between 1 and 500 elements.
Each element of the Array will be string containing valid command.
Each list will be between 1 and 20 variables/numbers.
Allowed working time for your program: 0.2 seconds. Allowed memory: 16 MB.
