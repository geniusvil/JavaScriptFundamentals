Problem 2 – Labyrinth Escape
You are given a rectangular field of size NxM, filled with numbers and directions. On each cell on the field there will be a direction marked with the letters l, r, u, d.
By given position (R, C) (Rth row and Cth column) the directions are as follows:
From (R, C) go l => (R, C-1)
From (R, C) go r => (R, C+1)
From (R, C) go u => (R-1, C)
From (R, C) go d => (R+1, C)
The numbers in the field are always as follows:
On the first row the values are from 1 to M, on the second row – from M+1 to 2*M, on the third row – from 2*M +1 to 3*M, on the Nth row – from (N-1)*M to N*M.
By given start position, find the path outside of the field, or print if you are lost.
Example:
N = 3
M = 4
Start position: 1 3
Input
The method Solve accepts a zero-based array of strings. The arguments are as follows:
args[0] contains M and N separated by a single space (" ")
args[1] contains R and C – the start position (the star position is zero-based)
args[2] to args[N+2] contain exactly M characters(only the letters 'l', 'r', 'u' or 'd')
Output
The output data should be printed on the console.
The output should contain a single string – "out SUM_OF_NUMBERS_IN_THE_PATH" or "lost NUMBER_OF_CELLS_IN_THE_PATH"
"out SUM_OF_NUMBERS_IN_THE_PATH" means that at some point you can go outside of the field
"lost NUMBER_OF_CELLS_IN_THE_PATH" means that you are stepping on a cell that is already visited
Constraints
N and M will be always between 1 and 500
Allowed working time for your program: 0.2 seconds. Allowed memory: 16 MB.
